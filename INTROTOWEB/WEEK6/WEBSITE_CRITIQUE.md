SITES WHICH I REALLY LIKE:

# DJI
(I LIKE THE STICKY ELEMENTS OF THE PAGE AND THE INTERACTIVNESS WITH PHOTO AND VIDEO ELEMENTS):

# APPLE VISION PRO
(SIMILAR TO DJIS WEBSITE, I ENJOY HOW THEY SEPERATE THE DIFFERENT TEXT AND VISUAL ELEMENTS WHERE SOME ELEMENTS ARE STICKY AND OTHERS ARE FIXED, THIS CREATES A VERY ENGAGING PAGE FOR AUDIENCES)

# NAVA PRESS
(I PARTICULARLY LOVE HOW THE LOADING SCREEN OF THIS PAGE IS LIKE A FILE DOWNLOAD. THE SCROLL FUNCTION OF THIS WEBSITE IS ALSO VERY UNIQUE AS IT SCROLLS IN A HORIZONTAL DIRECTION AS SUPPOSED TO VERTICAL. THE DROPDOWN MENU ANNIMATION ALSO WORKS NICELY)

# HEATH CARDS
(THE APPEAL OF THIS SITE IS BOTH THE SIMPLICITY OF THE WESBITE WHICH IS ABLE TO DELIVER VERY CLEAR INFORMATION  AND DIRECTOY. THE 3D GIF AT THE CENTER OF THE PAGE IS ALSO VERY INTERACTIVE AND AMUSING TO LOOK AT)

# BATH HOUSE
(I CHOSE THIS AS ONE OF THE SITES BECAUSE I REALLTY LIKE THE COLOR AND TYPOGRAPHY COMPOSITION. THERE IS A VERY CLEAR THEME THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE PAGE THAT IS CONSISTENT AND IS ABLE TO DELIVER THE MESSAGE WHICH THE BRAND IS TRYING TO GET ACROSS VERY CLEARLY)

# REPRESENT CO
(THE USE OF FULL WIDTH VIDEO THROUGHOUT THE HOME PAGE REALLY TAKES THE USERS ON AN ADVENTURE AND I THINK IT IS VERY EFFECTIVE IN PORTRAYING THAT ADVENTURE SEEKING THEME WHICH THE BRAND AIMS TO PROMOTE)
