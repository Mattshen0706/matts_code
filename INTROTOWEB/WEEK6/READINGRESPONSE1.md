I Chose this piece of work because it reminded me of a similar project I did in my creative coding class last semester which used visual animation, text transcribe and random library. Reabracdabra is a web based poem which utilises the strength of an early telecommunication platform created in Brazil called Videotexto. Videotexto allowed users to access information services, send messages and engage with all forms of content through terminals connected via telephone lines. Eduardo Kac, the poet of Readbracadabra has the art philosophy that the meaning of a poem should be understood as part of a dynamic overall environment. As a designer I agree with this ideology, when I present a piece of work (this could be a photo, video, graphic design), the medium itself is integral to accentuating the value of the artwork. A piece of art without the right presentation and medium will not be able to express an artist intent to the fullest. 

I think what's also interesting is the time period in which this was created. Around the similar time when videotexto was released (early 1980s), Brazil was still under a military dictatorship which meant there was censorship of media, artists and journalists, limiting freedom of expression. Especially considering the time frame, I think it's incredibly innovative how artists like Eduardo Kac even thought of expressing himself visually in a public domain through grafitis and visual poetry when the main mode of communication at the time was still through prints. 

Additionally I have done a lot of work in the past with typography and I really enjoyed how the artists played with various geometries which was likely very limitied back then to create very unique characters.
